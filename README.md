I love the creative side of coding. This means exploring and expanding my own technical limits by trying to create fun things.

# Games

In [Escape from Io](https://justinlycklama.github.io/Escape-From-Io/), manage a variety of robots to navigate though a rocky terrain. 

Delegate tasks and optimize robot efficiency to escape the planet as fast as possible. ( UI Designer wanted üòÖ )

# User Interfaces

As a Software Engineer I also appreciate modularity, and my experience in front end brings that to User Interfaces. 

Coming from an iOS background, I love creating components that adapt and animate to any set of input.

# Computer Graphics

I have not been able to explore shaders professionaly... but I think they are really cool!

Diving in to [Metal](https://developer.apple.com/metal/) (Apple's shader language) I created a 3d version of [Conways game of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).

# Apple Specifics
Playing around with [Sirikit, App groups and Shortcuts](https://medium.com/tribalscale/sharing-data-with-siri-and-realm-646e7b50c2bb), I made a simple app to remember your location when you say a certin phrase, "That Looks Cool".

Open the app later to see your saved locations, and export them into google maps or other platforms
